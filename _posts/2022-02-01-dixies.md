As I set off on my Kawasaki ER6N looking to get out of my work from home staple, that is becoming "prison", all I can think is "I need a view that never ends".
I ride out of my driveway, the beach restuarants start running through my head.
I decide on an old favourite, Dixies, and head out with more purpose.

Always a great ride along the coastal road or if you want to try and skip some of the Kalk Bay/ St James traffic jam then Boyes drive has a great elevated views of the bay (Wave to the Shark Spotters).

There is ample parking for my motorbike outside, I park it across the street which adds to my bike/sea view.

This is a touristy restuarant, but most tourist sit outside, so there is always space in the bar or the other inside areas.
I grab a seat in the bar section with a window view that could be a YouTube channel.

The clientelle is normally quite oldish, with the "locals" arriving almost on schedule every day after 16:00 for their ritual sundowners and banter.

Towards the end of the day the traffic outside starts to build up as others head home.
